# Hacking_Job_Descriptions
Along my journey to find a job I am both passionate about and qualified for, I've noticed unfamiliar terms and tools in some interesting job descriptions. In some cases I'll Google them and find out that I do have those skills afterall (I just wasn't using the same terminology) or wonder if maybe I should take some time to learn how to use a new software to make my resume more appealing. I thought it would be a fun and useful project to parse through jobs I've saved and compile a list of the most commonly desired skills.  

:warning: This is still a work in-progress :warning:  

## Tools Used
This project is written in Python, using the [Selenium automation tool](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) interfaced with [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) to pull job descriptions from preset LinkedIn job postings and using [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) to parse the text for valuable information.  

## How it Works and its Current State
In the future, I intend to make it easier and more automated to enter the job postings to be analyzed, but at the moment the links to each description need to be manually entered into the list <code>links</code> on [line 21](https://github.com/monk200/Hacking_Job_Descriptions/blob/ab7caca03e4f9b5a9e5da953bf4c56dcb5495701/job_descriptions.py#L21) of [job_descriptions.py](https://github.com/monk200/Hacking_Job_Descriptions/blob/main/job_descriptions.py). Running [job_descriptions.py](https://github.com/monk200/Hacking_Job_Descriptions/blob/main/job_descriptions.py) will prompt the user for their LinkedIn username and password, which is necessary so that the job postings can be expanded. It is important that the LinkedIn account does NOT have two-factor authentication turned on for the automation to work properly. [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) will open and [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) will pull the job descriptions from each post. All the descriptions will be output to [Job Descriptions.txt](https://github.com/monk200/Hacking_Job_Descriptions/blob/main/Job%20Descriptions.txt). The current job post links and job descriptions are from about the first 50 positions I applied to.  

After running [job_descriptions.py](https://github.com/monk200/Hacking_Job_Descriptions/blob/main/job_descriptions.py) with your own links (or if you just want to use my gathered data), [parse_job_descriptions.py](https://github.com/monk200/Hacking_Job_Descriptions/blob/main/parse_job_descriptions.py) needs to be run to analyze the data. It tokenizes all the words from [Job Descriptions.txt](https://github.com/monk200/Hacking_Job_Descriptions/blob/main/Job%20Descriptions.txt) then removes punctuation, stop words (common words that are unhelpful out of the context of a sentence), and a manually compiled list of unhelpful words. The manually compiled list can be found on [line 18](https://github.com/monk200/Hacking_Job_Descriptions/blob/ab7caca03e4f9b5a9e5da953bf4c56dcb5495701/parse_job_descriptions.py#L18) and was created by looking at the most common words and intuitively deciding that they are not going to help find desireable skills. Usually these words are broadly related to engineering, clearly from "equal opportunity" blurbs, or generic job posting words. After cleaning the data, the script searches for the most common individual words, bigrams, and trigrams.  

The ultimate goal here is that the ouputted words, bigrams, and trigrams give insights into what skills are most commonly desired in the job postings I am interested in. At the moment, the outputted lists are not particularly helpful. The individual words list looks as expected but the top 30 words don't contain any skills or terms I don't already have and wasn't expecting to see. Looking at a longer list of popular words might reveal more. As far as the bigrams and trigrams, they all have just one occurance because each job post is written uniquely enough that phrases aren't overlapping the way I had anticipated. I used the found list of bigrams and counted their number of appearances ignoring order, hoping this would show more meaningful data. When working with the collected data, this actually didn't add any information at all. This leaves me a little unsure of what steps I could take to continue finding common skills aside from adding more raw data.  

Doing my best to gather insights from this project, I created a [word cloud](https://github.com/monk200/Hacking_Job_Descriptions/blob/main/wordCloud.PNG) using the [100 most common individual words](https://github.com/monk200/Hacking_Job_Descriptions/blob/main/individual_words.txt). At the very least, this helps me rephrase portions of my resumes and cover letters but still hasn't met the goal of finding new skills to add to my repertoire. The word cloud can be seen below:
